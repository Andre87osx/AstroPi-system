<para>
The <quote>What's Up Tonight?</quote> (WUT) tool displays a list of
objects that will be visible at night from any location, on any date.
By default, the Date and Location are taken from the current settings
in the main window, but you can change either value using the
<guibutton>Change Date</guibutton> and <guibutton>Change
Location</guibutton> buttons at the top of the WUT window.
</para>
<para>
The WUT tool also displays a short almanac of data for the selected
date: the rise and set times for the Sun and moon, the duration of
the night, and the Moon's illumination fraction.
</para>
<para>
Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed.  The
objects are organized into type categories.  Select an object type
in the box labeled <guilabel>Select a Category</guilabel>, and all
objects of that type which are above the horizon on the selected
night will be displayed in the box labeled <guilabel>Matching
Objects</guilabel>.  For example, in the screenshot, the
<guilabel>Planets</guilabel> category has been selected, and three
planets which are up on the selected night are displayed (Mars, 
Jupiter and Saturn).  When an object in the list is selected,
its rise, set and transit times are displayed in the lower-right
panel (&ie; Mars rises at 17:13, transits at 21:46 and sets at 02:16).  
In addition, you can press the <guibutton>Object
Details...</guibutton> button to open the <link
linkend="tool-details">Object Details window</link> for that
object.
</para>
<para>
By default, the WUT will display objects which are above the horizon
between sunset and midnight (&ie; <quote>in the evening</quote>).
You can choose to show objects which are up between midnight and dawn
(<quote>in the morning</quote>), or between dusk and dawn (<quote>any
time tonight</quote>) using the combobox near the top of the window. 
You can also choose to see only those objects that are brighter than a 
magnitude by setting a minimum magnitude using the <guilabel>Show objects 
brighter than magnitude</guilabel> spinbox. You may center the selected object 
in the Sky Map or add it to Wish List by pressing the 
<guibutton>Center Object</guibutton> or <guibutton>Add to List</guibutton> button.
