HTMesh version 0.01
===================

This Perl HTMesh wrapper was written by James Bowlin based on the
original HTMesh C++ library (seemingly no longer maintained). After we
stripped down the HTMesh library for use in KStars (see
e.g. 0c344a2bf45594e9028f86d6c6a7d5e56b58bdfc -- one of the many
commits stripping the library down), Akarsh Simha had to modify the
perl wrapper to reflect these changes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, first build the stripped-down HTMesh library
with -fPIC flag (so it can be used in a shared object), otherwise the
linker will barf because HTMesh perl library needs to be built as a
shared object with symbols etc. To do so:

   1. Open kstars/kstars/htmesh/CMakeLists.txt and remove the comment
      on the -fPIC flag.

   2. make && make install in the kstars/kstars/htmesh directory

   3. Copy the libhtmesh.a object from the install prefix into
      /usr/lib or wherever the Makefile below will look for it
      (alternatively, point the Makefile to it)

   4. Revert the -fPIC uncommenting

Then, build the perl module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install # Or sudo make install depending on the prefix etc.
