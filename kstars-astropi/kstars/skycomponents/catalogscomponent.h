 * indexed catalog.
 *
 * The component doesn't follow the traditional list approach and
 * loads it's skyobjects into an LRU cache (`TrixelCache`). For
 * puproses of compatiblility with object search etc. some of the
 * brightest objects are loaded into `m_static_objects` and registered
 * within the component system. Furthermore, if some part of the code
 * demands a pointer to a CatalogObject, it will be allocated into
 * `m_static_objects` on demand.
 *
 * If you want to access DSOs in _new_ code you should use a local
 * instance of `CatalogsDB::DBManager` instead and call `dropCache` if
 * necessary.
